### Research Question 
- How did the reclassification of theft offenses under Proposition 47 affect reported county-level larceny-theft rates in California compared to pre-implementation trends?
### Estimand 
- Let Y_(c,t)be the reported county-month larceny-theft rate per 100,000 residents. I estimate dynamic average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) of California’s Proposition 47 (effective Nov 5, 2014 California Superior Court; coded as treated from Dec 2014 to avoid partial-month exposure) on Y_(c,t)for California counties over Jan 2010–Jan 2020. The counterfactual Y_(c,t) (0)is constructed from a matched/reweighted set of non-California counties selected to match pre-2014 larceny-theft trends and population density. Effects are estimated via an event-study difference-in-differences with county and month fixed effects. Identification assumes that absent Prop 47, treated counties would have followed parallel trends to matched controls and that spillovers across counties/states are negligible; I assess these via lead coefficients, placebo policy dates, alternative outcomes (e.g., burglary/robbery/violent crime), and permutation-based inference that assigns placebo “treatment” to other states. 
### Treatment Timing 
- Primary: t0 = 2014-12
- Sensitivity: 2014-11
### Outcomes 
- Primary: Larceny-theft
- Secondary/robustness: Burglary, robbery, violent crime 
### Control construction (placeholder)
- Matched or reweighted non-CA counties to match 2010-2014 pre-trends + density
### Inference plan (placeholder)
- Main credibility check will include placebo-state / permutation style comparisons (not just county cluster SEs)
