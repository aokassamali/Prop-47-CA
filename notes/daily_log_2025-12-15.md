# Notes
### What I did today
- Worked on clarifying on my research question. Determined my initial question was intractable, so moved to something with better data availability
- Set up github repo
- Wrote my initial memo, will work on updating as I refine
- Began doing initial research for datasets
### What Prop 47 is + what I'm estimating
- Prop 47 is a criminal justice reform measure that reduced certain low-level, nonviolent drug and property offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. The main tenets of the proposition were to reduce larceny-theft crimes where the value does not exceed $950 and unlawful possesion of most illegal drugs classified under personal use from felonies to misdemeanors. The bill also allowed resentencing and redesignation for individuals serving eligble offenses currently in prison. Finally, the state savings from reduced incarceration costs are to be deposited into a special fund and allocated to K-12 schools, victim services, and mental health / substance abuse treatment and diversion programs.
- I'm estimating the causal effect of Prop 47 on larceny-theft rates using non-CA counties with similar density and testing whether pre-treatment trends were parallel
### Tomorrow's goals
- Identify useable datasets
- Write decision Memo
- Begin verifying datasets
